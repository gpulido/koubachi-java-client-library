Koubachi-api-library HOWTO USE
==========================
Download the latest build with dependencies from the builds folder.
koubachi-1.0.X.with-dependencies.jar

Add it to the project libraries.

Getting started with the library
You would need a pair "app_key / user_credentials" values to be allowed to use the koubachi api.
Apply for them at koubachi labs api access code at labs.koubachi.com

Once they are adquired, they must be used to configure the Koubachi client library. There are several ways
to do it:

1. via koubachi.properties
Save a standard properties file named "koubachi.properties". Place it to either the current directory,
root of the classpath firectory. The file must have the following values:

userCredentials=**************
appKey=****************

2. via ConfigurationBuilder
You can use ConfigurationBuilder class to conigure Koubachi programatically as follows:

ConfigurationBuilder cb = new ConfigurationBuilder();
cb.setUserCredentials("****************************")
  .setAppKey("*************");
KoubachiFactory kf = new KoubachiFactory(cb.build());
Koubachi koubachi = kf.getInstance();


To obtain more information about the use of the api itself, read the koubachi.Koubachi class
