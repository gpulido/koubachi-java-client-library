koubachi-java-client-library
============================

Koubachi-java-client-library is a Koubachi API binding library for the Java language licensed under Apache License 2.0.

This library is a wrapper over the Koubachi BETA REST api.
To use this library a valid "user credentials - app key" pair is needed. To obtain them you need to register on labs.koubachi.com and accept the Koubachi terms of service.

The Koubachi-java-client-library depends on three opensource libraries: 
restlet - www.restlet.org - for the http and REST comunication
json - You can see the license term at http://www.JSON.org/license.html
gson - http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ To transform the json string onto java objects.

It also borrows some code and programing ideas from the great twitter4j library https://github.com/yusuke/twitter4j

VERY IMPORTANT
The koubachi API is still in Beta, and this library is also an early implementation that hopefully will be evolve as the koubachi api.
